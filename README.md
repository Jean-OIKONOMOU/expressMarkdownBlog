# What is this ?
This is the skeleton of an app that will be hosted on my raspberry pi and will be accessible to the rest of the world.

Here are the steps of this project :
- Building a Markdown blog app with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB.
- Setting my Raspberry Pi to host websites.
- Setting my Raspberry Pi to use mongoDB.
- Hosting my website on the Raspberry Pi for all to see.

# What technologies will be used ?

## For the website
This project is going to be built using Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. 

## For the Raspberry Pi
Bash for setting up the Raspberry Pi. There will surely be more technologies than just Bash but I haven't reached that stage yet.

# What's so special about this project ?
The special part is hosting this website on my raspberryPi. It should fetch my code on a github repository and then serve it to the rest of the world. 

The website in itself is just a test to see if I can host a website with a database linked to it on my Raspberry Pi.

# Documentation of my project
Here's a tutorial on how to turn a Raspberry Pi into a server that fetches data from a Github repo and serves it :

And here's a tutorial on how to host your own website on a Raspberry Pi :

By combining these two I hope to reach my goal soon enough.
